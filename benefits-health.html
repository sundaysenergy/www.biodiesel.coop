    <div class="content"><p>One of the first benefits Rudolph Diesel suggested was the psychological empowerment derived by individuals from the use of biodiesel. It gave the people, who were not privileged and able to access the steam engine's capabilities, an alternative - an engine that was actually more efficient. The entrepreneur, craftsman, artisan, and small industrialist an avenue to create, produce, and compete. This ability to partake successfully in society was empowering. The empowerment from finding an alternative to the local gas pump is as effective today as it was over one hundred years ago. People are even more aware today of the benefits personally and to our community.</p>
<p>Among the easiest benefits to identify in using biodiesel versus petroleum based diesel is the odor. Almost everyone has driven or ridden behind and truck or bus, inhaling the obnoxious and noxious fumes. Some people immediately get a headache, while others experience eye irritation. If one day, you are driving down the road behind a school bus or diesel truck and you are inundated with the smell of French fries - wonderful, luscious, hot French fries - and there is no fast food stand in site, it very well may be you are behind a diesel engine using biodiesel. The odor is not unpleasant or sickening.</p>
<p>In June of 2000, Biodiesel became the first alternative fuel to successfully complete the Tier I and Tier II health effects testing requirements of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990. In fact, at this writing, it is the only alternative fuel to have passed both Tiers. Tier I is a study of biodiesel emissions, while Tier II is a "90-day sub-chronic inhalation" study of biodiesel exhaust with health assessments.</p>
<p>In a comparison of the toxicity level of biodiesel and table salt, it was found that table salt was 10 times more lethal than biodiesel. There was "no observable effect" for systematic toxicity. Tests were conducted on small animals and fish, unfortunately, but fortunately, due to the lack of toxicity in biodiesel there were no adverse effects or any lives lost. In a skin test done on human beings, using pure biodiesel (B100) there was only a "very minor skin irritation", less irritation than the one created by a 4% soap and water solution on the control subjects.</p>
<p>Biodiesel is biodegradable, unlike petroleum based diesel fuel. Biodiesel comes from organic matter and will not pollute the water or the earth as it breaks down. Its elements are compatible. Too frequently these days, we hear about oil spills from ships transporting fossil fuel or leaks from the offshore rigs that dot our coastlines. The United States Accounting Office estimates 46 million gallons of oil are spilled per year, destroying whole communities of marine animals or coastal wildlife populations. The Exxon Valdez oil spill was 11 million gallons. A large spill but still less that 25% of the annual estimate and a kind of spill that does not happen too often. It is the small continuous or frequent leaks that cause the real damage not the media-making spill.</p>
<p>Add to this, the spillage from our vehicles that washes via our drains into our oceans, rivers, and lakes, causing them to be the most polluted in the world. Leakage from decaying infrastructure of our underground pipelines carrying gasoline and diesel to the far corners of our nation is seeping into our ground and water supplies. Our water tables are becoming polluted with this seepage, contaminating our precious drinking water. Some of the pipelines were laid in the 1920's, 1930's, and 1940's. They are literally rotting out. A good example of this damage is found along the California coast south of San Luis Obispo. In some places the sand is black with "tar" and oil.</p>
<p>Biodiesel degrades at a rate of 85% - 88% in water over 28 days. This is the same rate as dextrose, which is glucose or a sugar found in many plants. B20 or the blend with 20% biodiesel and 80% #2 diesel degrades two times as fast as pure #2 diesel. Non-toxic, biodegradable biodiesel is becoming the alternative fuel for boats on oceans, lakes and rivers. Many lakes in our nation now either suggest or require biodiesel in all boats as a measure to protect our aquatic environment.</p>
