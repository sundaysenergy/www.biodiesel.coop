    <div class="content"><p>We touched on the benefits of the use of biodiesel by the agricultural sector in the Health and Environment discussing. As we said, biodiesel is biodegradable and is not toxic to the water, soil, or animals. Damage to our aquatic life, the fishing industry, and our water supply as well as our agricultural fields and forests are reduced markedly because of this lack of toxicity. Acid rain destroys an estimated $2-$3 million worth of crops in the United States alone each year. The cost of the damage to animals and other wild life drives the cost of acid rain damage up even further. This destruction is reduced when biodiesel is used due to the lack of sulfurs.</p>
<p>But, these are not the only benefits to agriculture. The oils used in biodiesel production are often a by-product or residue from feedstocks used for other purposes. Soybeans provide 58% of the feedstock for biodiesel at this time. In the processing, the meal of the soybean is the most important and the most valuable with the oil being a byproduct Inedible tallow and grease, a byproduct of our slaughter industry, is the next largest source for feedstock with about a 20% share. The remaining 20% or so comes from other crops such as corn, walnut trees, sunflowers, wheat, barley, sorghum, rapeseed, peanuts, rice, and canola to name just a few. Biodiesel production is the third largest use for corn in the United States. The projected demand for biodiesel in the next few years will result in an expansion in agricultural production, helping the small farmers. These farmers have been struggling in today's economy with agri-business corporations gaining control and shutting them out. The demand and the style of production will keep the industry local, reducing the transportation issues for farmers as well. This, then, will create a sustainable, renewable agricultural industry with new jobs and markets for old traditional products.</p>
<p>As we turn to this alternative use for our crops and products, the expansion will be encouraged for other reasons. The confines of our thinking pertaining to fuel and the use of our crops will have been broken and altered. New uses can be explored and new crops will be added to the growing list of feedstock sources. Already research is being conducted into the possibility of algae farming and mustard oil as potential source crops for feedstock. Waste products will be eliminated as oils from by-products are turned into biodiesel. Other byproducts and waste from food production can also be directed into the biodiesel industry for conversion to fuels for transportation and home heating.</p>
<p>These expanding possibilities will add to the adaptability of a feedstock to a specific region for easy production. Byproducts such as grease and tallow that is slated for shipment overseas can be kept here and utilized to the benefit of our communities. Arizona is exploring the use of rice hulls as a source feedstock. California is working with algae, cotton and walnuts. Iowa and Nebraska are looking at tallow, wheat and corn. This adaptability and local orientation of biodiesel production reduces the need for a pipeline infrastructure, which among other benefits will reduce spillage damage to the environment. Again, this localization of the product and process will help small farmers to rebound from their struggle for survival precipitated by the agribusiness corporations.</p>
<p>One interesting way to look at the supply issue is with a simple formula of production that is 100 pounds of oil plus 10 pounds of "alcohol" produces 100 pounds of biodiesel and 10 pounds of glycerol. Using the 1998 tallow figures, you would have approximately 800 million gallons of biodiesel from that one feedstock. At 20% of source oil for biodiesel, that would work out to be 4 billion gallons of biodiesel fuel. Agriculture uses approximately 3 billion gallons of diesel fuel per year. If they used all the oils they produced today they could more than cover their fuel usage with B100. That is with no expansion being considered, no "new" crops, and no recycled oils as feedstock. The annual usage of diesel is about 10 times that amount. If we invested in the expansion and growth of the biodiesel industry, which is based on local agriculture, agriculture would reflect that same growth. Agriculture could easily expand.</p>
<p>Another interesting way of looking at the benefit to agriculture is the contribution they would make towards the carbon cycle. If they produced their own fuel from biomass and then ran their diesel engines on that biomass-based fuel, they would have a balanced carbon cycle. They would be producing the biomass that would be burned during its utilization as a fuel, producing the proper balance of carbon dioxide to be absorbed by plants to create new biomass for future fuels.</p>
<p>The expansion of the agricultural industry, the empowerment of small farmers, the localization of production, and recreating a healthful, balanced environment are direct benefits to agriculture in our country and in the world.</p>
