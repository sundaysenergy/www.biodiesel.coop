    <div class="content"><p>A shift from direct benefits to a more generalized one shows an important indirect benefit. Several positive attributes of biodiesel are important indirect benefits to the performance of the engine itself. Solvency and lubricity are starting point for this part of our examination.</p>
<p>If you spill biodiesel on a painted surface and let it set, more than likely you will deface the paint job. The same solvency attribute keeps your engine extremely clean as it maintains the cleanliness of a new engine. Or clears out sludge left by previous petroleum diesel usage. Diesel #2 forms sludge and creates sediments in engines, gas tanks, and storage tanks. Biodiesel removes this residue, resulting in cleaner engine burns and longer life for the engine. In those diesel vehicles built before 1972 rubber was used in hosing. The solvency will disintegrate the rubber hoses requiring eventual replacement. Today's engines are fitted with synthetic rubber hoses that do not disintegrate with biodiesel use, effectively eliminating that problem. It needs to be noted that B20 is too diluted by Diesel #2 to dissolve the sludge and residues left by the fuel, thus, it does not have the same effect on the life of the engine.</p>
<p>A second attribute of biodiesel is its lubricity. During the 1990's, sulfur was removed from diesel fuel in an effort to reduce emission pollution. The result was increased wear and earlier failure of engine parts, particularly the injector pumps. Lubricity additives were utilized in fuels to counter act this tendency. Biodiesel proved to be an important resolution to this problem. The lubricity of biodiesel and the fact it is a fuel as well enabled diesel engines to extend their lives with out an overdose of a chemical additive, since the "additive" was also behaving as a fuel. It was found that even a small amount, as little as a >B1 additive, increased the engine life markedly.</p>
<p>The efficiency of an engine using biodiesel is slightly lower than a Diesel #2 engine by 2-3%. The BTUs produced by an engine using biodiesel is 117,000 BTU/gallon while an engine using Diesel #2 gets 131,000 BTU/gallon. With the positive variable of the biodiesel taken into account the difference in economy is reduced from what appears to be 10% to 2-3%. At the same time, the total energy efficiency ratio (total fuel energy/total energy used in production, transportation, and distribution) is very similar. For biodiesel, the total energy efficiency ration is 80.55% and foe diesel #2 it is 83.28%. The total fossil energy efficiency ration (total fuel energy/ total fossil energy used in production, transportation, and distribution.) indicated that biodiesel is four times as efficient as diesel #2 is. The total fossil energy efficiency is 3.25% and .833% for diesel #2. Biodiesel yields 3.25 units of fuel for every unit of fossil energy consumed while diesel only yields .833 units of fuel for every unit of fossil energy consumed.</p>
<p>The cetane rating for biodiesel is higher than diesel. This number is used to measure ignition performance. The higher number indicates greater efficiency in ignition. Biodiesel has a cetane number of 48-65; diesel #2 cetane rating is 40-55.</p>
<p>The flash point of biodiesel is also noticeable higher than diesel's by an average of 100 C. This difference is an important safety factor in storage. Diesel will ignite at a much lower temperature than biodiesel, making biodiesel much safer to store and be around.</p>
<p>A final note in addressing performance issues of biodiesel is a comparison to ethanol. Both are renewable alternative fuels, but it seems that biodiesel is more reliable and compatible with engines than is ethanol. Few if any problems result from the use of biodiesel, whereas this is not always true of ethanol. Secondly, biodiesel positive net energy gain ration at 3.25 to 1 is much higher than ethanol's net energy gain.</p>
<p>Overall, the performance issues resulting in a similar energy efficiency ratio, a noticeably higher net energy gain, increase in ignition efficiency, extension of engine life, and safety factors in its use greatly benefit our world community. These benefits come at a much smaller price for the planet and the human beings who live on it. The same is true of the benefits to the agricultural industry and the community of beings provided by using biodiesel. The lack of toxicity, its biodegradable property, the integration and balancing of the carbon cycle, expansion of local a local industry are just a few we mentioned in our discussion. These benefits are all just a start in the dialogue.</p>
