    <div class="content"><p>The economic impact of biodiesel has been alluded to or implied in our previous discussions. Health, the environment, agriculture, performance, and the community, as a whole and individually, experience an economic impact from the use of biodiesel, forming the complexity of the economic issues. This impact with rare exception is positive and those instances where there is a negative impact it is offset by a correction that mitigates the issue.</p>
<p>In the discussion of the economic benefits of biodiesel, it is necessary to explore the economics of biodiesel and the fossil fuel industry as well. Keep in mind through this next discussion that at this point in time the biofuel industry is still regional, local, and operating with the community in mind. The large corporate conglomerates have not gained control of the industry, turning it into a deep pocket feed for them. Although, they are beginning to move into the alternative field - Shell Oil has purchased Siemans Photovoltaic Division, General Electric Astropower, and British Petroleum Solarex. Since the biodiesel industry is still functioning as a "free" industry, the economic benefits will be gains within the communities and regions as well as gains for the working individuals at all levels. Revenue will flow back into communities and not be siphoned off in support of large corporate structures.</p>
<p>Beginning with the beneficial impact on health, we saw a reduction or elimination of many of the pollutants and toxic compounds currently being emitted into the air by fossil fuel usage. With the reduction in pollutants comes a reduction in health costs as well. Diseases precipitated or caused by these pollutants cost more than $82 billion annually with the increased hospital admissions and the increase in emergency room and office visits. These are indirect costs of fossil fuel and they are every bit as much a part of the price as what we pay at the pumps.</p>
<p>The environmental benefits will be reflected economically as well. Water is becoming more scarce with each passing year and it will continue to do so as global warming continues. In addition to increased scarcity the waters of the rivers, lakes, oceans and water tables (in other words water in the water cycle at all points) is becoming more and more polluted. The absolute necessity of water to the survival of the planet will drive the value of water up. One factor in the correction of this problem is the use of biodiesel. Biodiesel is a huge step in that direction with its biodegradable property and its lack of toxicity. Aquatic life will remain available as a food source; fishing industries will have one less obstacle in maintaining their livelihoods.</p>
<p>30% of the greenhouse gases are produced by the transportation industry alone add to that other industries that rely on fossil fuels for power such as the electrical industry. These gases drive the global warming trend at much faster rate, changing the weather and climate all over the world. These changes are affecting our agricultural industry. It is also costing our communities with the increase in various weather related problems such as tornados, floods, and erratic rains.</p>
<p>We mentioned earlier the cost of crops lost to acid rain resulting from the emission of sulfur: $2-3 million in the United States alone. Biodiesel will eliminate or drastically reduce this loss as it reduces the content of the sulfur in the air. During the 1990s, an attempt to remove sulfur from fossil fuel was made, but the engines began breaking down more frequently. Additives were "created" to counteract the lack of sulfur. Over the years sulfur returned because it was cheaper to keep it than remove it from the fuel. Recently, the EPA has made another attempt to get the fossil fuel industry to remove sulfur by the later half of this decade, touting how the health of our communities will benefit. We will see how this goes. Will engines begin to breakdown again? Will this mandate become watered down and as ineffectual as it was the last time?</p>
<p>One creative way of increasing biodiesel production that would benefit the local community would result in enormous gains for agriculture. It was estimated that there would be $300 billion gross output in to the American economy in 2001 with $6.6 net cash to American soybean farmers. For every $1 in soybean oil based biodiesel there would be $1.50 created in the service industry plus taxes from income and salary, corporate taxes, and sales taxes. They estimated 300,000 new jobs could be created in the process. Dr. Dermot Hayes of Iowa State University projected a $400,000-$500,000 investment could be made to turn the Iowa State fleet to biodiesel usage. This would mean a new plant would be built to supply the fleet, creating and providing jobs. The resulting gain through taxes would more than offset the initial cost and would turn into a long-term savings for the state.</p>
<p>The expansion of the agricultural sector resulting from the development of biodiesel as a viable alternative fuel would increase the economic base of the industry. New crops added to the feedstock would expand the range of possibilities creating jobs and keeping revenue and taxes within the communities and regions. The renewable cycle would help stabilize the price, unlike what we will experience in the near future with fossil fuels or possibly are experiencing. As we find new crops such as mustard oil and as we convert more recycled veggie oils and fat, the commodity price for the feedstock will drop bringing the price of biodiesel down making it more competitive.</p>
<p>In April of 2002, the Senate approved a bill providing for a tax incentive for the use of biodiesel. It provided for a 1Â¢ reduction in the excise tax for each percent of virgin biodiesel fuel used and 1/2Â¢ for recycled oil based biodiesel per percent used up to 20% or 20Â¢ for B20 (virgin) and 10Â¢ for B20 (recycled). This is a minimal subsidy considering the petroleum industry is one of the most subsidized industries in the United States, but it did recognize biodiesel as a viable alternative fuel for today's market. The lack of and inequity in subsidies has kept biodiesel prices approximately $1 above that of Diesel #2. Typically, the prices of biodiesel runs from $1.35 - $2.75, although with recent events in the fuel market the price of biodiesel is going higher as is diesel fuel price increases. It seems the biodiesel industry wants to maintain this gap. It seems this would be an opportune time to gain a greater share of the fuel market by maintaining prices at a steady level. It is predicted that the price of petroleum products will not go down, in fact, it is anticipated that they will climb even higher. Federal encouragement and support to expand the biodiesel industry and the alternative fuel industry as a whole would begin to solve the problems confronting us economically. Their support in equalizing the subsidies, by either removing the ones for the fossil fuel industry or increasing those for alternative fuel including biodiesel would also help maintain prices. Finally, it would help if, in evaluating the price of diesel, we considered the "hidden" costs of health, the environment, and agriculture for a more realistic look at petroleum diesel's cost.</p>
<p>In looking at the economics of production and distribution, one gallon of biodiesel consumes 7.5 pounds of fat or oil in production, which is 75-80% of the operating costs. One bushel of soybeans produces between 7 and 12 pounds of oil, depending on the kind of processing. One gets about 1 - 1.5 gallons of biodiesel per bushel. The cost of feedstock is the key to biodiesel production. At 20Â¢ per pound, feedstock would cost $1.50 with the total cost about $1.89 per gallon (lowside). Soybean oil, a byproduct of soybean meal production, tends to be the most costly part of biodiesel production. This cost is somewhat offset by the sale of glycerol, the byproduct of biodiesel production, which is used in soaps, toothpaste, makeup, etc. Again, the big cost in biodiesel production is the feedstock. Keeping the feedstock local and using waste products will lower the cost drastically. As was mentioned previously, the cost of diesel is going up. It is a good time to look into alternative feedstocks, building a local production infrastructure, and providing a cost effective alternative to diesel in our communities.</p>
<p>Our domestic production has been decreasing as our oil deposits dry up. New areas are being explored and developed. Up to this time these areas have been deemed untouchable and special, because of their wildlife and pristine nature. These areas are now being encroached on and destroyed. One example of the devastating destruction of wildlands and habitats are being destroyed is Prudhoe Bay in Alaska. This oil complex has destroyed over 400 square miles of pristine wilderness. There are now 1500 miles of roads and pipelines cutting through what was once the largest wilderness area in the United States. 1200 acres of wildlife habitat and 500 acres of marine habitat have been destroyed by gravel fill, excavation and waste disposal. 300 cubic yards of drilling waste, about one billion barrels of "produced waters", 953 barrels of liquid oil waste and 300 cubic yards of oil-contaminated solid waste and sludge are produced each day and there are an average of one oil spill every 22 hours. Looking at the Arctic development, we can only surmise that the same level of destruction and economic costs would occur. It would take several years to create the drilling complex costing billions of dollars. All this for 9 daysâ€™ supply of oil. We do not have the deposits in the United States to sustain even a portion of our consumption rate. It would behoove us to look at our consumption habits, at the technology enabling us to make vehicles with lower fuel consumption rates, and at alternatives in resolving this crisis in energy creation.</p>
<p>Two of the strengths of the biodiesel industry are the regional and local sourcing and control. In other words, the materials for production are done at a local level and money is fed back into the communities that are served by the producers and distributors. As production infrastructure is developed this will be even more apparent. This is very different within the fossil fuel industry. The monopolization of the refineries by a few corporations is becoming starker. In 1981 there were 329 refineries owned by 189 companies. The top 10 companies controlled 55% of the market share. Over the next two decades refineries closed and mergers occurred. In 2001, 65 companies owned 155 refineries and the market share of the top 10 companies had grown to 62%. Mergers of these companies - Exxon and Mobile, BP, Amoco and Arco, Chevron and Texaco, Phillips and Tasco, and, finally, Valero and Ultramar - have effectively eliminated competition. Each is assured of a share of the market so pricing and customer service become moot. The top 5 refineries (these merged companies) control an average of 66% of the market - 90% of the East Coast market, 69% of the West Coast market, 62% of the Rocky Mountain market, 56% of the Midwest market, and 53% Gulf States market. There is much confusion and slight of hand around the control of prices and market share. The Federal Trade Commission had investigated, but with oil people running the administration, the outcome of these investigations is questionable.</p>
<p>In a more global perspective, the United States holds 3% of the world's oil reserves and uses 25% of the oil produced in the world. We use 231 billion gallons of crude oil per year. We produce 2.2 billion barrels of crude oil domestically and import 3.3 billion barrels. 60% of the petroleum used in the United States is imported. In 2001 we imported 9.3 million barrels of crude oil per day and today consumption has increased even more. This means that we send $200,000 each minute overseas or $288,000,000 per day or about $100 billion a year to buy the oil we are using. In 2001, we sent $75 billion overseas to pay for the crude oil we imported; $6.3 billion went to Iraq for its oil.</p>
<p>The decrease in the domestic supply and increased consumption is driving us into a greater dependence on foreign oil. Today, we are spending $100 billion a year on importation of crude oil. The trade deficits are growing each day. The United States is now the biggest borrower in the world and our trade deficits are out of balance. We are sending fewer goods out of the country than we are bringing in. Oil is a large part of this imbalance. Again reviewing the various solutions and working from several perspectives and options will be the answer. Among these answers is biodiesel. Increased production will impact the agricultural sector, our waste management, job creation, money influx into communities where service industries would grow, rebalancing our trade deficit and keeping a large portion of that $100 billion per year here at home, our health, and the environment are just a few of the numerous benefits from biodiesel's inclusion in the solution.</p>
