    <div class="content"><p>This discussion has been slowly shifting to the environment and its impact on human health. In 1990, Congress passed the Clean Air Act Amendments in an effort to reduce the high emission levels of harmful compounds found in the exhausts of cars, trucks and buses. We know this as air pollution that creates smog and sends particles and chemicals into the air that, when inhaled, precipitates various respiratory, cancerous, and other diseases. Hydrocarbons, speciated hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and lead are but a few components of fossil fuel driven vehicle emissions. These components are drastically reduced or eliminated by the use of biodiesel with the exception of nitrogen oxides which either remain the same or are slightly increased.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hydrocarbons are reduced by 95%</li>
<li>Speciated hydrocarbons are reduced by 50%</li>
<li>Carbon monoxide is reduced by 43%</li>
<li>Particulate matter is reduced as much as 86%</li>
<li>Sulfur oxides and sulfates are eliminated by using biodiesel</li>
<li>Aromatic compounds (mutagenicity compounds) are reduced 75%-90%</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide is reduced 78%</li>
<li>Nitrogen oxide is increased by 5.8%, but the use of an additive or a catalytic converter now virtually eliminates this increase</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand what these figures mean a little better, we need to look at how each of these components affect our environment and, ultimately, us.</p>
<p><u>Hydrocarbons, speciated hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide</u> all are major contributors to the formation of smog. Almost everyone has experienced smog in our country produced in a large part by our trucks and automobiles. A smoggy day can affect your breathing and create eye irritation. If nothing else, most are aware of the diminished visibility resulting from a complex chemical reaction that creates nitrogen dioxide - the brown haze. The figures above are for B100. A mere B2 or 2% biodiesel with 98% diesel will reduce carbon monoxide by 35 million pounds and hydrocarbons by 4 million pounds each year.</p>
<p><u>Particulate matter</u>, which is formed by unburned particles emitted into the air, causes respiratory diseases. Due to the oxygen in biodiesel particulate matter is burned more completely (see Biodiesel Properties), producing cleaner emissions. As we said, by using B100, particulate matter is reduced by as much as 86%. Again, with a mere B2 or 2% biodiesel, particulate matter is reduced by 3 million pounds per year. That is a lot less soot in the air for us to breath into our lungs.</p>
<p><u>Sulfur oxides and sulfates</u>, the main components of acid rain, do not exist in biodiesel emissions, because there is no sulfur in biodiesel. In a diesel blend, you have the fossil fuels, which contribute the sulfur, creating oxides and sulfates. When these sulfur chemicals are released into the atmosphere, they form sulfur dioxide and combine with the water resulting in sulfuric acid. This acid is carried by the winds around the world, dropping onto the land and its inhabitants when it rains, mists, or is foggy - acid rain. Utilizing a B2 blend, as above, removes 3 million pounds of sulfur oxide and sulfates from the atmosphere each year, saving the earth, the forests and agricultural fields, the water supply, and various animal populations from being bathed in sulfuric acid.</p>
<p><u>Carbon dioxide</u> is one of the greenhouse gases that are changing the global climate, much to the concern of scientists throughout the world. What is a normal warming trend has been exacerbated by these gases being released at an excessive rate into the atmosphere. They come from various industries and electricity producing plants, but 30% comes from the transportation sector of our society alone. If we use biodiesel, a reduction in carbon dioxide of more than 30% occurs. In the process of burning biodiesel, we create a "carbon cycle" rather than just emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere recreating a balance that previously existed. As the biodiesel is burned, it releases carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is then used in the photosynthesis process of the growing biomass, which is the feedstock for biodiesel. The carbon dioxide is reabsorbed by the biomass that will be converted to future biodiesel. This is a carbon cycle. It is sustainable and part of the renewable aspect of biodiesel. Returning to our B2, carbon dioxide will be reduced by 3 million pound per year. Increasing the blend will produce greater reductions in the greenhouse gases contributing to the global warming. Methane gas, another greenhouse gas, is also produced at a lower level. In this, case the reduction is 3%.</p>
<p>Cancer causing aromatic compounds found in exhaust emissions are eliminated or reduced markedly. Biodiesel (B100) contains no aromatic compounds, including PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) or nPAHs (nitrated PAHs). By using a B20 blend, all PAHs were reduced 75%-85% with the exception of benzo (a) anthracene, which was reduced only 50%. nPAH compounds were reduced to an even lower level. 2nitroflorene and nitropyrene were reduced by 90%, while the remaining nPAHs were reduced to just trace levels. Reduction in these carcinogenic and mutagencity elements which cause cancer is definitely a positive benefit for all human (animal) health.</p>
<p>The amount and kind of waste introduced to our environment is another advantage to using biodiesel. The fastest growing industry in the United States, and possibly the world, is the "fast food" industry. Their creation of waste fryer oil, which has to be disposed of in some fashion, is in the millions of gallons each year. This waste oil can be filtered and then processed into usable biodiesel, reducing the non-biodegradable waste created by this used oil. Wastewater from the creation of biodiesel is 79% lower than wastewater from the production of diesel, which is approximately five times greater. Hazardous solid wastes, resulting from biodiesel production, are 46% less than that resulting from diesel production. The non-hazardous waste is two times as great in biodiesel production as non-hazardous waste in diesel production. When looking at the figures, it seems, that making more non-hazardous waste as compared to hazardous waste is the better choice for our communities and the inhabitants of this earth.</p>
<p>Diesel fuel has been designated as a hazardous substance which may cause harm to those who come into contact with it, especially, for those who come into contact with it on a regular basis, such as in an occupational situation.</p>
<p>Conversely, the use of biodiesel or any blend thereof is not hazardous to human beings. Humans and animals are not harmed by direct contact with biodiesel nor are they harmed by inadvertent ingestion of biodiesel due to its lack of toxicity, though, it is fairly safe to assume it will not taste like French fries, despite its burning smell. The air we breathe would be much purer, and certainly more healthful, with the reduction of various chemicals and particles emitted by our exhaust systems - both vehicular and industrial. Although, there is a lot of work to do in removing carcinogenic pollutants from our lives, using alternative fuels and biodiesel would go a long way towards reducing the causes of this debilitating disease. The reduction in acid rain would help ensure the preservation of resources such as our forests, agricultural fields, water supplies, and animal life. (A side note: One reason for the demise of the "dinosaurs" thousands of years ago was the acid rain, resulting from a meteor collision, that fell to earth for ten years washing the animals in sulfuric acid.) The elements causing harm to living beings on this planet are either markedly reduced or are eliminated entirely with the use of biodiesel. The health and environmental benefits from using biodiesel or a blend of biodiesel are undeniable. Biodiesel is certainly an alternative to be seriously considered.</p>
