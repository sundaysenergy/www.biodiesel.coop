    <div class="content"><p>National Security has been playing on the edges of this discussion. 60% of our crude oil comes from a foreign source. The increasing dependence on this foreign oil has us dependent on supplies from the Middle East and OPEC, Venezuela, Columbia, and, more recently, Africa. In each of these areas we are exerting incredible political and economic influence in order to control and maintain the supplies needed to satisfy the US consumer. Venezuela is in political turmoil in large part due to the influence and interference of the United States in their political processes. Africa is dealing with community devastation and other upheavals from the economic interference exerted by the oil companies. And, we all know what is happening in the Middle East. Oil and our need for it to sustain our lifestyles certainly seem to be a major part in the extreme political and economic disruptions of these areas. Not only is money going out for direct purchase of the oil, but money is diverted to these areas as a result of our political and economic policies as well.</p>
<p>Developing domestic sources for oil is not an answer to the whole issue. All that does is maintain our dependence on fossil fuel. With the dwindling resources here in the United States, we are becoming less and less able to meet our own demands. Add to this the increases we have been creating, local resources are becoming even less able to meet the demand. The result again is a continuing and potentially increasing reliance on foreign oil. This is complicated by the fact that the foreign supply has about reached its peak and as the supply begins to dwindle there as well cost will rise even further. There is already word out that the Middle East's recovery is becoming more difficult as it is reaching the bounds of its major pool, ergo, the recent increase in the barrel price and the pump price.</p>
<p>Several measures can be taken to correct this overall dependence on fossil fuels. Two measures apply directly to the fuel industry. First, the technology exists that would enable cars to get better mileage per gallon. In 1975 CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards were established in response to the fuel crisis. The standard for cars was set at 27.5 mpg. For a while we began to meet that standard, but today it has been relaxed and the average is around 24 mpg. Light trucks, which include minivans and SUVs, had their standards set by DOT because they comprised only 20% of the market. The standard was set at 20.7 mpg. With this loophole, car manufacturers set out to extol the benefits of small trucks, the newly designed minivans for passengers, and, more recently, the Sport Utility Vehicles with their "all round" use, mainly passengers, and exceedingly low average of miles per gallon. Some of them are not even out of the 1-9 mpg range, worse than in 1973 when it was 11.6 mpg. Light trucks, SUVs, and minivans now comprise over 50% of the passenger car market. We need to apply the available technology and raise the miles per gallon and with what we know we could easily reach 40 mpg by 2012. This would cut our transportation fuel consumption almost in half.</p>
<p>A second measure would be to explore alternative fuels - biodiesel being one of many. Natural gas and propane face many of the same disadvantages as fossil fuels - limited supplies. Hydrogen cells require fossil fuel or some other kind of fuel to create the hydrogen cell. They also require water, a resource that is becoming more precious each day. Biodiesel and other biofuels are viable options although they may not be the end solution. They can be locally produced, using local resources and providing all the environmental, health, agricultural, and economic benefits explored earlier. Moving in this direction with the support of our communities and government would add markedly to a reduction in the dependence on foreign oil.</p>
<p>Biodiesel is a viable option to our dependence on foreign oil. It is most applicable in the transportation sector and can be used in other energy creating industries such as heating and electricity. Our national security will be restabilized when we as a nation take the necessary steps to make changes in our lifestyles. Biodiesel can be a part of that change. Already individuals, businesses, and governmental entities are seeing the benefits of using biodiesel. The military and other governmental agencies are part of that movement and have incorporated biodiesel usage into their diesel fleet operations. We do not need to depend on others if we are willing to take the initiative in the control of our habits and consumption. The interference and disruption in other countries we are perpetrating in the name of oil can be eliminated, thus, reducing the anger towards America and the need for revenge.</p>
